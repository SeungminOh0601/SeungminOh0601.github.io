    <h3>About Myself</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 20px">
    <em>I was born in South Korea, but I had lived in America in my childhood until I was 7. After graduating from high school in Korea, I got a chance to study in Canada.
      I used to play a lot of interesting console games and it somehow made me want to make one of those exciting and beautiful games. As mobile game markets were getting bigger
      and a lot of game engines were made so everyone can develop their own creative games, I got interest in making games. After a lot of studies and trial and errors, I was able to
      launch my own games and some of them were successful. Someday in a future, I want to make high quality, movie-like games that can move people's hearts.</em>
